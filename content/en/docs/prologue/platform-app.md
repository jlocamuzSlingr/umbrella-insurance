        <b><li><h6> Administrators:</h6></b>
        The admin is a user with full control over the insurance app's functionality and data.

        <br><br><b>‚ùáÔ∏è  Restore Data - the process of copying <code>backup data </code> from secondary storage and <code>restoring it </code> to its <code>original location</code> or a new location. </b><br><br>

        <b><li><h6>Agents:</h6></b>

This user typically has access to specific parts of the app, such as customer information, policy information, and  claims. The agent can create and manage policies, track claims, and communicate with customers.<br>
        Although agents have a smaller scope of functionalities compared to administrators, they play an important role in the app.<br> Agents have access to the claims panel, but only for their respective customers' claims. They can also access a view that lists all their customers to have a global view of them. In the administrator section, agents can view all types of coverages.
        <br>Agents have access only to their own information, while global information is exclusively available to administrators.
        <b><li><h6>Customers:</h6></b>

<div class="summary2">
    <b><h5>Policies management üìÉ</h5></b>
In the context of insurance, a policy is a contract between an insurance company and an individual or organization that outlines the terms and conditions of the insurance coverage. It specifies the type of coverage being provided, the amount of coverage, the cost of the coverage , the length of time the policy is in effect, and any other relevant details of the agreement. <br> The policy serves as a legal document that both the insurer and the insured must adhere to.Depending on the user's group, they can create, edit, delete, and read their own policies or policies of others within their panel. These policies can cover various areas such as home, health, or car insurance.
<br>
In the policies management of an insurance app, the roles and permissions of admin, agent, and customer typically differ as follows:
<ul>
<b><li>Admin: </li></b>The admin user has full control over policies management in the insurance app. They can create, edit, delete, and manage policies as well as policyholders. The admin can also view reports and analytics related to policies, such as premiums collected and claims filed. Additionally, they can configure system settings and manage user accounts, including agents and customers.

<b><li>Agent:</li></b> The agent user typically has limited control over policies management, as their primary role is to sell and manage policies on behalf of the insurance company. They can create new policies and manage policyholders, such as adding or removing beneficiaries, updating contact information, and processing policy renewals. Agents can also view policy details and premiums, track claims, and communicate with customers regarding policy-related inquiries.

<b><li>Customer:</li></b> The customer can only manage their own policies and policyholders. They can view their policy details, make premium payments, file claims, and communicate with agents or customer support for assistance. The customer can also initiate policy changes, such as adding or removing beneficiaries, updating contact information, and making policy renewals.
</ul>
Overall, the admin has the highest level of control, followed by agents and then customers, who have the most limited access to policy management features.
